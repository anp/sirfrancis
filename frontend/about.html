      <h2>What SirFrancis does & why</h2>

      <p class="lead">Movie discoverability is a problem. We're hoping to offer a good solution.</p>

      <p>We've all used various streaming services for movies,
        and they are in many ways very useful and cool. However, they have limited libraries and thus limited
        recommendations they can offer. The best recommendation algorithms in the world can't recommend a movie not in
        their library,
        and if it's in their library they can't recommend it to you if you only watched similar movies using a different
        service.</p>

      <p>This sucks because there's no point to having 3 streaming movies subscriptions if you can't find movies
        you like to watch. There are some services out there which attempt to unify data from various services, and
        they're pretty cool too.

      <div class="small">Warning: this is where we get a little more technical.</div>
      But they usually use one of two methods to help you find things:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Old (read: dumb) methods like lists of the Top 50 Best Action Movies, etc.</li>
        <li>Attempts to mimic the user-stereotyping algorithms that the big companies use.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>These methods don't work well enough for independent watchlist services. Top 10/25/50/100/10,000 lists
        can only go so far and lack any kind of personalization. The user-activity algorithms that bigger companies
        use are expensive to host, and rely on having tons of user data. They also have the effect of
        only recommending items to you if "people like you" also watched them and liked them. If you like to watch
        multiple genres, you're out of luck. If you like every Liam Neeson movie <i>and</i> every cheerleading movie,
        your recommendations will probably never be all that comprehensive or good.</p>

      <p>We're building a lightweight, smart, private movie recommendation system. Lightweight enough to run
        on a single server. Smart enough to suggest movies based on their attributes and
        the way they're made, rather than what other viewers think. Private because your habits are never used
        to tell other people what to watch, and their preferences will never pollute your recommendations. Further,
        we make every effort to encrypt <i>all</i> traffic (front- and back-end) using TLS (strictly speaking SSL
        is never used).</p>
